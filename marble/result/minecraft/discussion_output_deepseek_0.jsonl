I need this information to coordinate with Agent3 for auxiliary block removal.\"\n\n**Message to Agent3 (once status is known):**\n\"Agent3, update: [Brief status based on Agent1's response]. Continue monitoring auxiliary blocks. I'll signal removal once all target blocks are confirmed.\"", "agent3": "Based on your role as **agent3** (auxiliary block placement/removal specialist) and the provided blueprint, the most appropriate next task is to **place a temporary access structure** to assist the team.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n*   The blueprint shows the first layer of the building at `y=-60` (one block above ground level `y=-61`).\n*   Your primary role is to place and later remove auxiliary blocks to aid construction, not to place the final blueprint blocks.\n*   A common starting auxiliary task is to build access, such as a dirt ladder, so that agents (especially agent2, whom you support) can easily reach the build layer and future higher levels.\n*   With no prior task history or discussion memory, this is a safe, proactive, and helpful action that aligns perfectly with your specialty.\n\n**Recommended Next Task:**\n`erectDirtLadder` at `[-11 -61 -2]`\n\n**Why this task fits:**\n1.  **Auxiliary:** It's a temporary structure for access, not a final blueprint block.\n2.  **Helpful:** It provides a safe way for the team to reach the build height (`y=-60`) and scale the structure as it grows.\n3.  **Non-interfering:** The chosen location is just outside the current blueprint area and on solid ground (`y=-61`), so it won't block any planned blocks.\n4.  **Removable:** You can later `dismantleDirtLadder` or `MineBlock` it when it's no longer needed, fulfilling the removal part of your role.\n\n**Next Steps After This:**\nAfter completing this task, you should **check with agent2** (e.g., via chat/discussion) to see if they need any specific auxiliary support, such as:\n*   Temporary walkways to reach distant blueprint blocks.\n*   Support blocks to place blocks in mid-air (per Minecraft rule 3).\n*   Clearing terrain or removing temporary blocks previously placed."}, "task_results": [], "summary": "```json\n{\n  \"task_summary\": \"Build a structure in Minecraft according to a provided blueprint containing material, facing direction, and position data for each block.\",\n  \n  \"blueprint_analysis\": {\n    \"total_blocks_required\": 6,\n    \"materials_needed\": {\n      \"dirt_path\": 4,\n      \"dirt\": 2\n    },\n    \"positions\": [\n      \"dirt_path at [-10, -60, -1] facing A\",\n      \"dirt_path at [-9, -60, -1] facing A\",\n      \"dirt_path at [-9, -60, 0] facing A\",\n      \"dirt_path at [-10, -60, 1] facing A\",\n      \"dirt at [-10, -60, 0] facing A\",\n      \"dirt at [-8, -60, 0] facing A\"\n    ],\n    \"ground_level_note\": \"All blocks are placed at y=-60 (1 block above ground level y=-61)\"\n  },\n  \n  \"agent_results_analysis\": {\n    \"status\": \"No agent execution results provided\",\n    \"note\": \"The input states 'Agents' Results Summary:' but contains no actual results data.
